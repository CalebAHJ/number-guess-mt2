# number-guess-mt2
This is a number guessing game based off of the Code Breaker minigame in Megami Tensei II.

The game will generate a three digit number which the player will have 6 tries to guess. A player will get a hit if he/she guesses a correct number and placement and a blow if he/she guesses a correct number but not placement. Each digit in the number will be unique. (Meaning 112 is not a valid number)
